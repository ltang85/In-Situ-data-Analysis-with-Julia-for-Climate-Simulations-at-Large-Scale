# Julia for HPC: In Situ Data Analysis with Julia for Climate Simulations at Large Scale

This repository is the archive of our JuliaCon paper and code for reproducing the results in our paper.


## Structure

**Important** do no fork this repo to create a JuliaCon submission.
The JuliaCon paper should live in the repository of the software you are presenting in a `/paper` folder at the top-level.
If you do not want to introduce a `/paper` folder in your software, you can do so in an arbitrary branch.
